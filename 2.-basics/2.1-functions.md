# 2.1 Functions

Before diving into calculus, let's discuss briefly about what functions are and where we use them.

Essentially, a function is a relationship between some inputs and an output. For example, if we had a function for modeling the distribution of temperature in a room, it may take $$x,y,$$and $$z$$coordinates of the specific location as well as the time $$t$$ as inputs. Then, the function $$f(x,y,z,t)$$ would return us the temperature at this coordinates, at this specific point in time.

Like so many areas in math, the idea is straightforward but the notation can make things unnecessarily confusing. It's sometimes fairly arbitrary historical reasons that decide this, like the different people inventing different parts of maths at different times or because a particular notation style is more convenient for the specific application it was developed for. For example:

$$\frac{dy}{dx}=y'(x)=\hat{y}=Dy$$

Just like any other language, mathematical language is full of quirks and irregularity but we have to learn it in order to enjoy it's poetry. Machine learning is a whole genre of this poetry.
